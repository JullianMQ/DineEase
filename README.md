# DineEase

A modern web application called DineEase was created to assist restaurants in giving their patrons a flawless online experience. Restaurants can use DineEase to display their digital menu and make it simple for patrons to book seats online. This method provides an effective, contactless method of managing dining experiences, improves convenience, and lowers manual reservation errors.

Restaurants frequently struggle to manually manage reservations, update menus, and give customers the most recent information in today's hectic setting. By offering a single platform that connects restaurant management and patron interaction, DineEase tackles these problems.

## For pages:
Home -> Menu -> Reservation -> About
Admin Login -> Manage menu item -> Manage reservations

## For database (DineEase):
